Admin Generator works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.<br>

## Quick Overview

```sh
npx admin-gii-cli my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

If you've previously installed `admin-gii-cli` globally via `npm install -g admin-gii-cli`, we recommend you uninstall the package using `npm uninstall -g admin-gii-cli` or `yarn global remove admin-gii-cli` to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

### Get Started Immediately

You **don’t** need to install or configure tools like webpack or Babel.<br>
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Create a project, and you’re good to go.
